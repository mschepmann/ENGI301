# Morse Code Decode Game

This project was made for ENGI 301 taught at Rice University. I made this code for a game, which I documented at this site: https://www.hackster.io/Mina_Schepmann/morse-code-decode-1b9f1d. 
I made this code using APIs provided by Professor Erik Welsh. I had honestly never done object-oreinted coding before, so I am very proud of this work. It was not easy but I had a lot of fun doing it. This whole project is a work in progress and the code is not complete, however I will be continuously updating the code until it is complete. If interested, check out my commit statements, and I will keep this README updated.
Thank you!
